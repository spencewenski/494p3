In Vision, the environment is completely black unless you walk into it or it is reacting to music. Throughout the game, you will pick up multiple “guns,” each of which adds a unique layer of music when fired and allows hit objects to react to that layer of the music (this music is not yet implemented). In addition, each gun has a unique effect on the object it hits. You will use these guns to navigate and solve puzzles. The following is a description of each type of gun you will encounter:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Outline: This gun allows you to see the target’s outline.</li>
<li>Push: This gun pushes the target away from you.</li>
<li>Trampoline: This gun turns the target into a trampoline.</li>
<li>Speed: This gun allows you to move faster along a target’s surface.</li>
<li>Anti-Gravity: This gun toggles the direction of gravity for the target between up and down.</li>
</ol>
Switch between guns using the number keys (e.g. 1 for the outline gun, 2 for the push gun, etc.) or mouse wheel.
<br><br>
Press F12 to reload the current level, and R.Shift+[12345] to load a specific level.

In the fifth level, which is under construction, the number bindings for the guns are set to 1:Outline, 2:Push, 3:Anti-Gravity.
